rather than go through SpanishDict for conjugations, etc., let's be a little more naive.
Simply download the wikitionary page for a given word on the word list and, also simply,
obtaining the meaning, lemma, and properties from said page will be enough (the latter step
will be done by another repo).  There is no need to go hunting in SpanishDict for the other
conjugations of a given word etc.
